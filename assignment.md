        * aria roles, 
        * proper HTML syntax and 
        * overall showing consideration for accessibility by adding attributes that may assist users.

* You must use the Bootstrap framework for building your portfolio. This would require you to include links to the Bootstrap compiled/minified stylesheet and javascript in the correct part of all 3 html pages you develop.
